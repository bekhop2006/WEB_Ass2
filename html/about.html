            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            We are two students from Astana IT University, passionate about learning and improving our skills in IT. This website was developed as part of our university assignment, not only to achieve the best grade but also to gain real hands-on experience in web development.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to go beyond the classroom and apply our knowledge in practice â€” creating a project that combines both functionality and design. Through this assignment, we learned valuable lessons in teamwork, frontend development, and building user-friendly platforms..</p>
