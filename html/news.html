                <h2>Tickets for ‚ÄúKairat‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúReal‚Äù: Kazakhstanis criticize the sales system</h2>
                <p class="news-meta">Published on September 22, 2025 by Sariyev Maxot</p>
                <img src="../images/photo_523404.png.webp" alt="Tickets for "Kairat" vs. "Real"">
                <p>Today, September 23, at exactly 5:00 p.m., the long-awaited ticket sales for the Champions League match between Almaty's "Kairat" and Madrid's "Real" officially began. Even before the system opened, it was expected that the interest would be enormous: tens of thousands of fans were preparing to join the virtual queue in hopes of securing the coveted tickets. However, the launch also drew considerable criticism. And, of course, it didn't go without jokes, reports Tengri Life.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>The ticket sales system, which was supposed to handle the massive demand, experienced technical difficulties from the very beginning. Many users reported being unable to access the website, while others complained about the confusing interface and long waiting times. Social media was flooded with memes and complaints about the system's performance.</p>
                    <p>Despite the technical issues, thousands of tickets were sold within the first hour. The match, scheduled for October 15th at the Almaty Central Stadium, is expected to be one of the most attended football events in Kazakhstan's history.</p>

                <p class="news-meta">Published in September of this year by Tanibergen Beknur</p>
                <img src="../images/images.png" alt="Higgsfield AI Product" class="circular-image">
                <p>"Higgsfield is a generative artificial intelligence model that creates videos based on text queries. The startup has raised $16 million in investment from renowned Silicon Valley venture capital firms. It currently competes directly with products from major tech giants like Open AI and Google," said Zhaslan Madiyev in April of this year.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>The investment round was led by prominent venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. The funding will be used to accelerate product development and expand the team of AI researchers and engineers.</p>
                    <p>Higgsfield's technology represents a significant breakthrough in video generation, allowing users to create high-quality videos from simple text descriptions. The company plans to launch its public beta version in the coming months, with a full commercial release expected by the end of the year.</p>
